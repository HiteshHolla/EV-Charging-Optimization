<!-- About the project -->

## About the project

This project proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based technique for charging a plug-in Electric Vehicle considering real time pricing of the electricity grid. The technique was able to achieve a 30% reduction in the consumer's electricity via implementation of this strategy.

### Built with

* MATLAB

<!-- Getting Started -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of MATLAB
* Download Link for MATLAB : [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html?s_tid=gn_getml)
* Understanding of Particle Swarm Optimization technique. Basic tutorial video : [PSO Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhgDMAm-imI)

### Installation

1. Download the folder named "Project Code" and run the file named "obj2" which contains the main PSO code.
2. Remaining files are for plotting the various curves which show the difference between the conventional charging and PSO based charging.

## Usage

1. The PSO parameters can be changed in the obj2 code as per the user's requirments and reused in different scenarios where optimization is required for large scale search space problems.
2. Given below is the flow chart of the PSO algorithm. Please keep it handy while going through the code in the obj2 file.
